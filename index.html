    <h2>Welcome to Intersection</h2>
    <p>Intersection is a Chicago-based nonprofit dedicated to creating change through dialogue.</p>
    <p>Prejudice is defined as “Preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.” Intersection events facilitate actual experience in an effort to replace prejudicial thoughts with genuine relationship and engagement with another person.  A study published in Science found that “Perspective-taking, ‘imagining the world from another’s vantage point,’ is one thought process theorized to be especially cognitively active that has has been shown to reduce prejudice…”  By encouraging dialogue among participants, we are also encouraging our participants to imagine one another’s experiences. It is by shedding light on these challenging topics, acknowledging their existence and exploring the controversy, that we can begin to build bridges of understanding and mutual respect.</p>
